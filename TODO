What do we have:

* Reworked RISC-V multicycle processor
* Fork of riscv-tools and associated repositories with 'riscy-v1' branches
* Tandem verification working with minimal changes to riscv-tools
* Reworked C++ code for connectal infrastructure
* Generate exceptions for misaligned memory accesses
* Performance counters
* Linux boots under tandem verification with the new multicycle

What do we need to do:

* [bug] multicycle processor has issue with timer interrupt happening at same
  time as store commit
* [bug] htifStall causes a problem with typing and printing at the same time
* Change RISCV_HOME to RISCY_HOME
* Separate code that is specific to connectal back-end
* Link performance counter txt file with android.exe so you don't have to copy
  over the txt file to the FPGA
* Improve gitignore to ignore build folders
* Figure out if this notation can be legal:
    - let {addr: .phyPc, exception: .exMMU} = mmuResp.first;
* Top level organization
    - Google Repo vs Git Submodules. We are currently using Git submoduels
      because of riscv-tools.
    - Do we have a separate repository for processors? What about a separate
      repo for non-processor BSV?
* Add MIT License.
    - Do we add it to the top of all the files or just add a LICENSE file? How
      does it interact with other LICENSE files?
* Cleanup BSV source (lib, etc.)
    - Use Fence interface
    - Redo CSRF Interface
    - Add python generator for BSV Opcodes
    - Rely on [riscv-opcodes] or [riscv-meta] more
    - Performance Counters
* Add parameterization to the processors
    - e.g. which ISA subset to include
* Improve Spike's HTIF for tandem verification
    - Currently we have to do loops of ticking to ensure Spike's HTIF finishes
      a syscall.
    - Console input and output doesn't stay synchronized.
* [procs] Make stop interface method send a "stopped" verification packet
* [procs] Add reset vec to a configured register like miobase
* [riscv-opcodes] Add code to emit CSR enumeration
    - Integrate new CSR enumeration into our processor
* [riscv-isa-sim] Clean up tandem verification code and commit
    - Possibly add a new c++ file to spike
    - Maybe move some of the synchronization code to spike
